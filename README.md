CSC309 Summer 2020 Team Project
==============
## Introduction
Our Project is a web application which is an online clinic, where patients can chat with doctors about their symptoms and get a prescription sent to them through the app. This is aimed at more common ailments (colds, headaches, behind counter supplements like iron pills, UTIs, etc)and not used for more complex cases.
